This is the README file for this project.

I originally created this project by following through with a tutorial I found here:

http://www.iphonegametutorials.com/tag/objective-c/

The most important thing to note is that this project is using the cocos2d API. Cocos2d is a great 2D game engine, but
it can definitely be used for creating other kinds of apps. It is very well documented in itself, take a look.
